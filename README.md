My Personal Portfolio towards my journey to become a software engineer!!!

The website is functional and completed. Although it is still missing projects which I am currently working on :)
Hosted in Netlify: https://airulaiman.netlify.app/


Completed:

Main components of the website (Home, Resume and Contact page)
Added UI/UX design
Added animations for components
Responsive web design
Implementing contact functionality
Code clean-up, refactoring and optimization for performance
Final user testing for performance & usability
Future work:

Adding future completed projects + their transitions (each project card will direct to a new page) into the Project page
